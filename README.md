# SuperMercadoBot

This is a shopping list Telegram Bot that I made to help me and my family manage grocery shopping.

## Usage

### +

`+` is used to add items to the list. To add potatoes, for example, say `+ potatoes`. It works with item lists too, separated with commas. `+ potatoes, ketchup, rice`.

### -

`-` is used to remove items from the list. To remove potatoes, for example, say `- potatoes`. Current version does not support removing more than one item.

### lista

`lista` is used to get the current shopping list. 

### apagar

`apagar` empties the current shopping list.

### recuperar

`recuperar` prints the last emptied list. Should be used as a backup when a list is emptied without being supposed to.
